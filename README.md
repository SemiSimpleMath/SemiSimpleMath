Hello,

I am semisimplemath.  My passion is machine learning and in particular deep learning.

The purpose of my github is to share some of the work that I have been recently doing.   Most things here are my own projects that I have worked on for fun / curiosity / to learn new things.
Not all of my work ends up on my github.  For example I cannot post work that I do for others.  Also I prefer not to publish work that may become commercial or be published in a journal later.

I am happy to discuss anything you might find interesting.  My contact is semisimplemath@gmail.com
